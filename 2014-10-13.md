# For week of 13 October 2014

* Follow ups
  - [x] **Blue Aaron** - Mental health talk
  - [x] **Coraline**   - Write/Speak code workshop
  - [x] **RT**         - Thank him for helping
  - [x] **Chris Se**   - Arlington Ruby mentorship
* Is it Paleo?
  - [x] search functionality (fuzzy/suggestion)
  * Depending on your goal with this, there are two possible approaches I can think of:
    1. If it's just for learning, then you might want to implement this functionality yourself, to see how it might be done.
    2. If you're more interested in it working, then do some research into how others provide search functionality and try to use one of those solutions (I don't have internet now, but I think Solr and Sphinx might provide this functionality, maybe also check ruby-toolbox to see if there's anything like this.)
  * Here are some potential requirements, choose the ones you're interested in, modify as you like, you can keep the Cucumber style and use Capybara (if you need help with this, let me know) or translate to RSpec:

      Feature: Searching for items
        It's lunchtime, I feel the hungahz!
        I need to know if the food is Paleo, because that's my diet.
        Sometimes I'm spot-on with my typing, but this phone is small,
        my fingers slip, so on and so forth.
        
        Background:
          Given "Hamburgers" are not paleo
          And "Corn on the cob" is paleo

        Scenario: Exact search for a non-paleo item
          When I search for "Hamburgers"
          Then I see a "no" gif
        
        Scenario: Exact search for a paleo item
          When I search for "Corn on the cob"
          Then I see a "yes" gif

        Scenario: Case insensitive search
          When I search for "hamBurgers"
          Then I see a "no" gif
        
        Scenario: Search for an unknown item 
          When I search for "Power adapters"
          Then I see (what should happen here?)
        
        Scenario: Non-exact match
          When I search for "Ham Burgers"
          Then I see a "no" gif
          And I am on the "Hamburgers" page
          
        Scenario: Partial match
          When I search for "Burgers"
          Then ??

        Scenario: Suggest completions as I type.
          Given "Hamburgers" are not paleo
          And "Corn on the cob" is paleo
          And "Acorn" is not paleo
          When I type "co" into the search box
          Then I am suggested "Corn on the cob" and "Acorn"
      ```
