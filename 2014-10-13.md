# For week of 13 October 2014

* Follow ups
  - [x] **Blue Aaron** - Mental health talk
  - [x] **Coraline**   - Write/Speak code workshop
  - [x] **RT**         - Thank him for helping
  - [x] **Chris Se**   - Arlington Ruby mentorship
* Is it Paleo?
  - [x] search functionality (fuzzy/suggestion)
  * Depending on your goal with this, there are two possible approaches I can think of:
    1. If it's just for learning, then you might want to implement this functionality yourself, to see how it might be done.
    2. If you're more interested in it working, then do some research into how others provide search functionality and try to use one of those solutions (I don't have internet now, but I think Solr and Sphinx might provide this functionality, maybe also check ruby-toolbox to see if there's anything like this.)
  * Here are some potential requirements, choose the ones you're interested in, modify as you like, you can keep the Cucumber style and use Capybara (if you need help with this, let me know) or translate to RSpec:

      Feature: Searching for items
        It's lunchtime, I feel the hungahz!
        I need to know if the food is Paleo, because that's my diet.
        Sometimes I'm spot-on with my typing, but this phone is small,
        my fingers slip, so on and so forth.
        
        Background:
          Given "Hamburgers" are not paleo
          And "Corn on the cob" is paleo

        Scenario: Exact search for a non-paleo item
          When I search for "Hamburgers"
          Then I see a "no" gif
        
        Scenario: Exact search for a paleo item
          When I search for "Corn on the cob"
          Then I see a "yes" gif

        Scenario: Case insensitive search
          When I search for "hamBurgers"
          Then I see a "no" gif
        
        Scenario: Search for an unknown item 
          When I search for "Power adapters"
          Then I see (what should happen here?)
        
        Scenario: Non-exact match
          When I search for "Ham Burgers"
          Then I see a "no" gif
          And I am on the "Hamburgers" page
          
        Scenario: Partial match
          When I search for "Burgers"
          Then ??

        Scenario: Suggest completions as I type.
          Given "Hamburgers" are not paleo
          And "Corn on the cob" is paleo
          And "Acorn" is not paleo
          When I type "co" into the search box
          Then I am suggested "Corn on the cob" and "Acorn"
      ```

* Vim Adventures
  * Level 7 directions are lacking, needed help to find location of keys:
    - [Find keys and directions hidden in bushes throughout level](http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/103845/how-do-i-pass-the-level-7-will-find-forward-puzzle-in-vim-adventures)

Things to discuss:

 - **Test quality** I have 12 passing spec tests. They're all model tests. One feature test based on Josh's example above with   6 scenarios and 28 steps, all passed. Are they written well though? How much more should I test? Should I write controller tests?
 
 - **Using data tables vs. factories in Cucumber.** I started off trying to use data tables but I had trouble saving the data to then use in following steps. So I switched to factories instead.
 
 - **Where to place factories.** I wrote my spec tests before I wrote my feature tests and factories. After I passed all my feature tests I ran my spec tests again and realized two were failing because they were picking up information from the factories. The factories file is in my /features/support directory though. I don't mind my specs using the factories, but I should probably move the factories file out of /features/support so it's more apparent, right?
 
 - **Database cleaner transaction vs truncation.** At one point my scenarios weren't passing because the home page wasn't rendering links of the food being searched. The first scenario would pass, but then for the rest of the scenarios when the search field was typed into no foods appeared below it. I switched the order of the scenarios to make sure I didn't mistype and it was always the first scenario worked, but the ones below it didn't. I ended up changing the database cleaner configuration from:
 
 ``` 
 Cucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy = :truncation
 ``` 
 
 to: 
  ``` 
  Cucumber::Rails::Database.javascript_strategy = :transaction
  ```  
  
  and that seemed to do the trick, but I still don't fully understand why. In fact from what I read using :transaction is faster but could cause threading problems. Don't really know what threading means either, though.
  
Other happenings
- Robots! Saw Julian on Saturday at Nova Code and Coffee. Talked robots and getting started. Wound up buying an Arduino starter kit later that day. Haven't played with it yet since I was focused on test writing, but we're planning to try some things during the Arlington Ruby on Wednesday. He should me a Ruby framework for it called [artoo](http://artoo.io/). I think it could be a fun way to write Ruby.

- Resume :( Have to update my resume so I'm ready at any moment should a job opportunity arise. Want to do a full overhaul, content and formatting. 

## Josh's notes from the week
* **Placing url logic in models:** I dislike that the model, an object which I would like to be a simple ignorant data structure (just have some attr_accessors, and not know or do anything related to the web, or even the db, ideally) has this knowledge about how it should be rendered into a url. I don't exactly know what I'd want instead, but I know that even though everyone places it there, that ideally there would be some separation. Maybe what I'd like would be for the path helpers to know to know how to turn the model into the path, so like:

    ```
    def food_path(food)
      "/foods/#{food.name||raise("No name on #{food.inspect}")}"
    end
    ```
