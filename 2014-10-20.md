# For week of 20 October 2014

* For Britney
  * is it paleo
    - [ ] search box on foods/show page
    - [ ] case insensitive searching
    - [ ] db.yml out of gitignore, with reasonable defaults
    - [ ] try to find a big list that you can scrape and dump into your db
    - [ ] Visually inform user about paleology (e.g. background colour)
  * vim
    - [ ] Better configurstion
    - [ ] Syntax Highlighting
    - [ ] Window management
  * robots
    - [ ] Get your arduino set up
  * resume
    - [ ] when you think about a job you'd be excited for every morning, what does it look like

* For Josh
  - [X] Some helpful vim configuration
    ```vim
    "" ===== General setup =====
    " Turn on file-format awareness based on extension, enable indentation awareness
    filetype plugin indent on

    " Turn on syntax highlighting
    syntax on
    syntax enable

    " Don't handicap vim b/c of historic vi capabilities
    set nocompatible

    " Use utf-8 (so you can have fancy characters like åß∂ƒ)
    set encoding=utf-8

    " Display incomplete commands
    set showcmd

    " display tabs as 2 spaces, convert the tab key to 2 spaces
    set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2
    set expandtab

    " backspacing works on everything
    set backspace=indent,eol,start

    " highlight search matches, allow incremental searching
    set hlsearch
    set incsearch

    " Explicitly tell vim that the terminal supports 256 colors (just allows richer colour options)
    set t_Co=256

    " Turn off those stupid files it litters all over your filesystem
    set noswapfile

    " add top/bottom buffer between cursor and window
    set scrolloff=4

    " colours the line the cursor is on
    set cursorline

    " turn on line numbers
    set number

    " replaces %/ with current directory, and %% with current file
    " e.g. try typing ":vs %/" quickly, then pressing tab to complete to a file, then press enter to vertically split with that file in the other window
    cmap %/ <C-R>=expand("%:p:h")."/"<CR>
    cmap %% <C-R>=expand("%")<CR>
    ```
  - [X] vim cheatsheet for window management
    Read "C-`<char>`" as "Hold control and press `<char>`"
    * *`:vs <file>`* vertically split the current window, opening `<file>` in the other half
    * *`:sp <file>`* same, but horizontal split
    * *`:w`* close the current window
    * *`C-w h` or `C-w <left>`* move left one window
    * *`C-w l` or `C-w <right>`* move right one window
    * *`C-w j` or `C-w <down>`* move down one window
    * *`C-w k` or `C-w <up>`* move up one window
  - [X] Write them up for you in a way that you can easily incorporate them
  - [X] Send you the arduino config stuffs
    * Walkthrough is here: [http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/arduino/introducing_arduino.html](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/arduino/introducing_arduino.html)
    * The section dealing with all that stuff is in "Prepare environment"
    * but also look at "Bootstrap Dino" section, as I had to troubleshoot this gem, and it is likely be similar to your issues.
  - [ ] review the https://github.com/wrightcheek/getting-started/blob/master/outline.md and make sure I'm not forgetting or missing anything.
  - [X] figure out how to do the data tables and share the example
        * [Here](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/d2fd9b7d5b69c75ffef8) are three examples of common things you might want to do with them, and how to pull it off
