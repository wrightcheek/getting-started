# For week of 8 December 2014

* Josh
  * Rails Kata (Britney's Grabbag)
  * Make it
  * Perform it!
* Britney
  * Portfolio
    * Do this after getting library done :) after library
    * Get a big list of things you found interesting enough to do
    * For each one, think of
      * A short paragraph explaining why it's interesting
      * A visually interesting way to represent it (e.g. screenshot)
  * Text me address so I can send xmas gift!
  * RSpotify: contribute remove tracks function from playlist
  * Ruby, not Rails
    * reach out to Chris Sexton about ruby not rails
    * get Julian and Sean's ruby not rails stuffs
  * Readbooks
    * Expose data from acceptance tests helper methods into the test itself (pass literals in as arguments)
    * Centralize authentication
      * put pry just before the auth call
      * then do `show-source methodname` to see how it's implemented
      * implement the body locally
      * then pull it up to the ApplicationController and have the subclasses delegate to it
      * swap `ENV['ARG1']` out for `ENV.fetch('ARG1')` so that it blows up helpfully if we forget to provide auth
