## Notes on [britneywright/exercism_json](https://github.com/britneywright/exercism_json/blob/a3e59bfebb488f56c3ae866194a54478b39d8d9a/lib/github.rb)

The code `options[:repo_name].split(",")`, in `call_contributors`
is parsing command-line arguments. We'd like this method to be
callable from anywhere in our app, so we want to push things like
dealing with commandline arguments up higher. In this case, we'd push
it all the way up to `parse`, on line 9. We probably need to do
`argv[2].to_s.split(",")`, so that it works correctly whether there
are arguments or not.

```ruby
nil.to_s.split(',')            # => []
'repo1'.to_s.split(',')        # => ["repo1"]
'repo1,repo2'.to_s.split(',')  # => ["repo1", "repo2"]
```

We'd want to make the option name plural, since it's now an array.
And so the check on line 15, `argv[2] == nil` would become
`options[:repo_names].empty?`, which allows us to think in terms
of the names, making it easier to reason about.

This means that now, down in our `call_contributors` method, we don't
need to have two different code paths. The case where there is only one
repo name is now the same as having multiple repo names, in both cases,
we'll just iterate over the repo names, however many there happen to be,
and perform the appropriate job.

To handle some of the complexity of the code in `contributors`,
we can push it down into methods that contain that complexity,
and give a name to it, so that we can think in more abstract terms.
For example, we have the line `number_of_pages = first_page.headers["link"].split(",")[1].match(/&page=(\d+)/)[1].to_i`
This could be changed to be something like `number_of_pages = num_pages(first_page.headers["link"])`
Which we would push that code down into:

```ruby
def self.num_pages(link_header)
  link_header.split(",")[1].match(/&page=(\d+)/)[1].to_i
end
```

It is possible that there could be several methods extracted from `contributors`,
and we might also do a similar thing for one of the other methods. If this happens,
it could be there are sets of methods all on our `Github::Json` object, that are
called together, and independent of each other. For example, we can see that `contributors_url_for`
is only called from this method, so we would have at least two methods pulled out of this.
If this seems to be true, that's a good sign that we should separate them,
so that we can take each idea independently, and prevent
its changes from messing with the rest of the code. A common way to do this is to make
an object, though, if it seems pointless to have an object (ie we don't find ourselves
feeling a need to store instance variables) then we could make them all singleton methods,
like we currently have, but just placed on a different object than `Json`.

Here is how that could wind up looking. Currently we have `response = contributors(options)`.
If we made it into an object, it might look like `response = Contributors.new(options).call`,
which would then imply a renaming like `contributors = GetContributors.new(options).call`.
And if we did something like that, and decided there was no real value in making it an object,
we could do it entirely in class methods like this: `contributors = GetContributors.call(options)`
